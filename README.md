# docsify-copy-code


copy from [jperasmus/docsify-copy-code](https://github.com/jperasmus/docsify-copy-code)


the copied content always has a line feed character which makes me crazy when i use it as a password string.
so i modify the js file.
when you don't need the line feed character, you should 
```
    ```text
    password
    ```
```
